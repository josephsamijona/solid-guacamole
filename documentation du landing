### Employee Attendance Tracking System with QR Codes

I'll create a plan for an employee attendance tracking system using QR codes to monitor when employees arrive and leave, as well as manage time off requests.

```typescriptreact project="employee-tracking"
...
```

## Implementation Plan

Here's a comprehensive plan for implementing the QR code-based employee attendance tracking system:

### 1. System Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js web application with responsive design
- **Backend**: Server-side API endpoints for data processing
- **Database**: Store employee profiles, attendance records, and time-off requests
- **Authentication**: Secure login for employees and administrators


### 2. Core Features

#### Employee Management

- Create and manage employee profiles
- Assign unique QR codes to each employee
- Set roles and permissions (admin, manager, employee)


#### Attendance Tracking

- QR code scanning for check-in/check-out
- Real-time attendance monitoring
- Late arrival and early departure tracking
- Overtime calculation


#### Time-Off Management

- Request submission interface
- Approval workflow for managers
- Leave balance tracking
- Calendar integration


#### Reporting

- Attendance reports (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Time-off usage reports
- Department-specific analytics
- Export capabilities (PDF, CSV)


### 3. Implementation Steps
